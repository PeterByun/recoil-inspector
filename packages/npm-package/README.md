The NPM package of the Recoil debugger is installed on the user's application in order to collect data for the debugger to work. <br/>
It should only be activated on development mode. <br/>

It's primary functions are:

1. Listen to state changes.
2. Transforms the state change data to a tree.
3. Send the transformed data to the extension.

Check [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/PeterByun/recoil-inspector-project) for more information.
