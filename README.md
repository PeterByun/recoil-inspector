## Features ‚ö°Ô∏è

- <strong>State and Components Visualization ‚öõÔ∏è</strong>
  - See which components are referencing which Recoil states and props.
- <strong>State Changes History ‚è∫</strong>
  - See how states have been changed over time. You can compare two changes to see exactly which properties have been updated, deleted, or added.
- <strong>Tree-shakable üå≥</strong>
  - It is activated only when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development`, and to avoid increasing your application's bundle size, it is lazily loaded only when enabled.

# Installation Guide üíø

1. Install the [React Devtool extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) if you have not already.

2. Install the NPM package.
   ```zsh
   npm install recoil-inspector
   ```
3. Import the package in your entry point like the below examples.

<strong>Next.js App Router</strong>

```tsx
// layout.ts
// NOTE: "use client" will not be needed in the future. We will keep the "use client" directive in the RecoilInspector component.
'use client';

import { RecoilInspector } from 'recoil-inspector';
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <RecoilRoot>
        <body>
          <RecoilInspector />
          {children}
        </body>
      </RecoilRoot>
    </html>
